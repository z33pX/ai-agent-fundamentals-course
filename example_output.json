    "final_report": "**1 What are the primary categories of US visas available?**\nThe primary categories of US visas available can be broadly classified into two main categories: Nonimmigrant Visas and Immigrant Visas. Nonimmigrant Visas are issued for temporary visits to the United States, including Visitor Visas (B1 and B2), Student Visas (F1, F2, and M1), Exchange Visitor Visas (J1 and Q), Temporary Work Visas (H1B, H2A, H2B, H3, L1, O1, P, R1, TN/TD, E3, and I), and Transit and Crewmember Visas (C and D) [1](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/).\n\nImmigrant Visas, on the other hand, are for individuals who intend to move permanently to the United States, including Immediate Relative & Family Sponsored Visas, Fianc\u00e9 and Spouse Visas, Employer-Sponsored Visas (EB1, EB2, EB3, EB4, and EB5), and Other Types of Immigrant Visas (Diversity Immigrant Visas and SB Visa) [1](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/).\n\nAdditionally, there are special categories of visas, such as Treaty Trader and Investor Visas (E1 and E2), Diplomatic and Official Visas (A1, A2, G, and NATO), Visas for Victims of Crime and Human Trafficking (T and U), and Visas for Refugees and Asylees [1](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/).\n\nIn total, there are over 20 categories of US visas, each with its own specific requirements and purposes [1](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/).\n\n**References:**\n\n**1:** [Visa Guide World](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/)\n**2:** [US Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/other-visa-categories.html)\n\n**1.2 What are the main types of immigrant visas, and what are their specific purposes and eligibility criteria?**\nThe main types of immigrant visas in the United States are categorized into three groups: family-sponsored visas, employment-sponsored visas, and special immigrant visas [1](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/). \n\nFamily-sponsored visas include spouse and fianc\u00e9 visas (K1 and K3), immediate relative visas (IR1-IR5), and family preference visas (F1-F4) [1](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/). These visas are for family members of US citizens and lawful permanent residents.\n\nEmployment-sponsored visas include EB1-EB5 visas, which are for priority workers, professionals with advanced degrees, skilled workers, special immigrants, and immigrant investors [1](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/). The Diversity Visa Program, also known as the Green Card Lottery, is another type of employment-sponsored visa for persons from countries with low immigration rates to the US [1](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/).\n\nSpecial immigrant visas include the Returning Resident Visa (SB Visa) for permanent US residents who have stayed outside the US for more than a year, and the SI Visa for Iraqi and Afghan translators or interpreters working with the US military [1](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/). There are also visas for victims of crime and human trafficking, such as T and U visas [1](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/).\n\n**References:**\n\n**1:** [Visa Guide World](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/)\n\n**2 How do specific visa options within each primary category compare in terms of requirements and benefits?**\nThe United States offers various visa options within each primary category, each with distinct requirements and benefits.

The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows travel to the U.S. for tourism or business without a visa for stays up to 90 days [1](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/other-visa-categories.html).\n\nDiplomats and foreign officials can apply for the Diplomats & Foreign Officials Visa (A) for official government travel [1](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/other-visa-categories.html), while employees of international organizations and NATO personnel can apply for the Employees of International Organizations & NATO Visa (G, NATO) [1](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/other-visa-categories.html).\n\nAdditionally, there are visa options for specific professions, such as the Temporary Religious Worker Visa (R) for temporary work in the U.S. for a religious organization [1](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/other-visa-categories.html), and the Crewmember Visa (C-1/D) for travel to the U.S. as a crewmember on a ship or aircraft [1](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/other-visa-categories.html).\n\nEach visa option has its unique requirements and benefits, and applicants must carefully review the eligibility criteria and application procedures to ensure they apply for the correct visa.\n\n**References:**\n\n**1:** [U.S. Department of State - Other Visa Categories](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/other-visa-categories.html)\n\n**1.1 What are the main types of non-immigrant visas, and what are their specific purposes and eligibility criteria?**\nThe United States offers various types of non-immigrant visas, each with its specific purpose and eligibility criteria. There are 40 different types of non-immigrant visas, which can be broadly categorized into several groups.\n\n**Travel and Tourism**: Transit Visa (C Visa) for travel through the US to another country [1], Visitor Visa (B1/B2 Visa) for tourism, visits, or business [2], and Visa Waiver Program (VWP) for citizens of participating countries to travel to the US for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less without obtaining a visa [1].\n\n**Work and Education**: Student Visas (F and M Visas) for academic and vocational students [2], Exchange Visitor Visas (J1 Visa, Q1 Visa) for participants in exchange programs and practical training [2], and various work visas such as H1B Visa for highly specialized fields, H2A Visa for temporary agricultural workers, and L1 Visa for intracompany transferees [2].\n\n**Special Purposes**: Diplomats & Foreign Officials (A Visa) for representatives of foreign governments on official travel [1], Temporary Religious Worker Visa (R Visa) for temporary work in the US for a religious organization [1], and Visas for Victims of Criminal Activity (U Visa) and Victims of Human Trafficking (T Visa) [1].\n\n**Other Categories**: There are also visas for journalists and media representatives (I Visa), athletes, artists, and entertainers (P Visa), treaty traders and investors (E1 and E2 Visas), and informants (S Visa) [2].\n\n**References:**\n\n**1:** [US Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/other-visa-categories.html)\n**2:** [Visa Guide](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/)\n\n**1.3 What are the statistical trends in the issuance of these visa categories over the past five years?**\n**Statistical Trends in US Visa Issuance over the Past Five Years**\n\nOver the past five years, the US has issued various types of visas, including nonimmigrant and immigrant visas. Nonimmigrant visas include visitor visas, study and exchange visas, work visas, treaty trader and investor visas, humanitarian and official visas, and transit visas [1](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/). According to the US Department of State, the number of nonimmigrant visas issued has increased steadily over the past five years, with a total of 10.3 million visas issued in 2020 alone [2](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics.html).\n\nIn terms of specific visa categories, the number of visitor visas (B1 and B2) issued has remained relatively stable, with around 7 million visas issued in 2020 [2](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics.html). Study and exchange visas (F1, M1, J1, and Q) have seen a slight increase, with around 1.2 million visas issued in 2020 [2](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics.html). Work visas (H1B, L1, O1, P, and R1) have also seen an increase, with around 650,000 visas issued in 2020 [2](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics.html).\n\nImmigrant visas, also known as Green Cards, have seen a slight decrease over the past five years, with around 1 million visas issued in 2020 [2](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics.html). The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is the main immigration authority for US visas, and visa application procedures vary depending on the visa category, type, and the applicant's country [1](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/).\n\n**References:**\n\n**1:** [Visa Guide World](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/)\n**2:** [US Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics.html)\n\n"
