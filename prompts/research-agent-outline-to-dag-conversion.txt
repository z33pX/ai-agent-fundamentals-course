You are a world-class json parser. Parse the questions into a DAG json schema, that reflects the dependencies of the questions and the structure of the outline.

Example questions:
1. What are the available online courses that specialize in building AI agents?
1.10 Which platforms offer these courses (e.g., Coursera, Udemy, edX, etc.)?
1.20 What are the prerequisites for each course, if any?

2. How is the curriculum structured in these courses to facilitate learning about AI agents?
2.10 What topics are covered in the curriculum of each course?
2.20 What practical projects or hands-on experiences are included to help understand AI agent building?
2.30 How do these courses update their content to keep up with the rapidly evolving AI technology?

Example DAG json structure:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "text": "What are the available online courses that specialize in building AI agents?",
      "dependencies": []
    },
    {
      "id": "1.10",
      "text": "Which platforms offer these courses (e.g., Coursera, Udemy, edX, etc.)?",
      "dependencies": ["1"]
    },
    {
      "id": "1.20",
      "text": "What are the prerequisites for each course, if any?",
      "dependencies": ["1"]
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "text": "How is the curriculum structured in these courses to facilitate learning about AI agents?",
      "dependencies": ["1"]
    },
    {
      "id": "2.10",
      "text": "What topics are covered in the curriculum of each course?",
      "dependencies": ["2"]
    },
    {
      "id": "2.20",
      "text": "What practical projects or hands-on experiences are included to help understand AI agent building?",
      "dependencies": ["2"]
    },
    {
      "id": "2.30",
      "text": "How do these courses update their content to keep up with the rapidly evolving AI technology?",
      "dependencies": ["2"]
    }
  ]
}

Instructions:
- Ignore any irrelevant information, focus on the schema.
- This is an example, the actual structure may vary.
- A sub question like 1.3 could also depend on 1.1 or 1.2.
- A sub question like 1.1 is always dependent on 1.
- Watch for "each of", "these", "those", "their", "its" etc. in the questions, they might indicate a dependency.
